On January 1, I decided to try a [Yearly Theme](/blog/2021/01/01/2021-resolutions.html) over traditional New Years' resolutions. With this goal, it is also suggested to track your progress throughout the year using a [Theme Journal](https://www.thethemesystem.com/), which you can learn more about on the The Theme System website.

Unfortunately, the physical journal was completely sold out when I found out about it, so I decided I would write mine in Markdown and also [publish it on this website](/themejournal/) to keep me on track.

I am plan on updating the website version at least once a week, as my journal section is only tracked weekly. There's also  "Daily Themes" section which I chose to track various aspects of my life that I wanted to loosely quantify how I am doing throughout the year. I usually fill out this table at the end of the day or the next day in the morning. I'm hoping I'll be able to plot this data over time at the end of the year to see how well I did.

In spirit of my Year of Intention, I am also tracking my weight and my average time per week. This also gives me data I can track over time, but also not psychologically discourage me by checking everyday. This is especially true with my weight, where I know I'll get discouraged when there are weight fluctuations. 
I hope this inspires others to consider trying this for themselves! Wish me luck. 

If you would like a copy of my Markdown theme journal, feel free to [contact me](/about/#contact) and I can send you a template!
