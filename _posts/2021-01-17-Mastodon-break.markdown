I started noticing that I have been creating the same compulsive habits with [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), the only [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) instance that I have been actively involved with. Even though I enjoy the community, as it gives me a place to express my nerdy side that I don've experience with my real life friends, I find myself constantly opening the website or mobile apps, looking for some sort of response or gratification. These were the same problems I had with traditional social media such as Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.
This sort of behaviour is at odds with my [Yearly Theme](/blog/2021/01/01/2021-resolutions.html) of Intention.

I've decided to uninstall all Mastodon apps from my phone and also block [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org) from my [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) account, my DNS provider setup on my router and my phone's private DNS, thereby preventing me accessing the website. I will try to do this for one week and see if my habits change. I will still be reachable if you'd like to [contact me](/#contact) and likely will be blogging still if topics come to mind. 

Until next time!
