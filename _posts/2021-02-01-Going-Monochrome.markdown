*Edit (Feb 14 2020): I decided to make a small update to the website by incorporating colors using [Material Design](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html) guidelines. If you have issues seeing anything on the site, please let me know by [contacting me](/#contact).*

As much as I love [Nord Theme](nordtheme.com), I was growing tired of the color scheme on my web site. I decided to change things up and also simplify the the number of color variables I had in my SCSS files. After reading about readability and accessibility when choosing colors in [this article](https://venngage.com/blog/color-blind-friendly-palette/), I decided to constrain myself to a completely monochromatic, gray color scheme.

I really like how it looks so far, but I might fine tune the shades of gray Iaboutm using for the layout. I also asked my friend [Lauren Beecher](https://laurenbeecher.com) to update my [avatar](/images/me.png) to use my natural skin tone and hair color, which I'll likely re-add to the site once that's ready.

Let me know what you think by [contacting me](/#contact).
