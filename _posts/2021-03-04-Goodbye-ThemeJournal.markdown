I haven've blogged in a while and I decided I needed to just dump my thoughts about various things that has been occupying my time. Although I am not participating in [#100DaysToOffLoad](https://100daystooffload.com), this blog is very much in spirit of that style of writing.

## Quitting my Theme Journal

After missing two weeks in a row of updating my [Theme Journal](/blog/2021/02/11/Reevaluating-my-ThemeJournal.html), I've decided to abandon it entirely and also remove it from my site. My reasons why are below.

### Mental Health

2020 was a really hard for me mentally, which I won've go into detail here. Even though 2021 has been better so far, it has still been a very hard for me to find motivation on personal projects. I thought the theme journal would motivate me to break out of this shell. Thinking about this theme journal has become more of a chore than a introspective exercise. In some cases, I feel guilty for missing it so many weeks in a row. 

### Reducing Decisions 

This is somewhat related to mental health, I've recently been going through an self-evalulation on how many things I want to have to check on a daily or weekly basis (more on this below). This clearly became something I didn't find valueable anymore.  

### A digital journal was a mistake

I think I would have had more success if I had gone the paper route for this theme journal. At the time of starting my Yearly Theme, I thought a digital one using markdown would be sufficient. I've been using a pen and paper notebook for work and find it incredibly useful to track tasks and keep my thoughts organized. Furthermore, I find myself rediscovering how much the creative and habit-forming process comes from just putting pen to paper. I may revist this in the future, but I will let myself decide that when the time comes.

Overall, I'm happy with trying this process and maybe I'll try again in the future once things are more normal!

## Digital Minimalism: Cutting Excess Accounts

I've recently been going through a sort of re-evaluation with online accounts through various aspects including, but not limited to:

* Personal Finance
* Abandoned & Unused Accounts 
* Instance-Hopping in the Fediverse

Some of these decisions are at odds with privacy & security, while others are definitely in favour of it. I will summarize the big changes below.

### Personal Finance

Toward the end of February, I realized I had credit card, banking and investment accounts scattered across several institutions. To alleviate some of this, I was using [YNAB](https://ynab.com) to consolidate looking over accounts and also budgeting my expenses. As much as I loved [YNAB's zero-sum](https://www.youneedabudget.com/why-we-budget-to-zero/) budgeting model, it was hard to justify its ~$84/year price when the service doesn't seem to give you much more than access to their account. After closing some unused accounts and consolidating my investments, I was able to comfortably cancel my YNAB subscription. I am now using a fairly basic LibreOffice spreadsheet to manage my finances, using zero-sum budgeting. It was reduced my security risk from breached accounts and less revolving credit cards, which is also a bonus.

### Abandoned & Unused Accounts
In addition to consolidating my finance accounts, I've been also randomly been looking for more accounts to delete that I no longer use. My old Gmail emails, as well as my password manager Bitwarden as been particularly useful for finding these old accounts. I believe I am finally at a point to delete my Microsoft account, but we will see if I end up doing it!

### I [tried] changing Fediverse instances

About a week ago, I decided to switch from [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) to a Math-focused instance called [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz). As some of you know, I have a [background](/about) in applied mathematics and missed thinking about it on a daily basis, as my day job isn've particularly math focused. I ended up aliasing and moving my Fosstodon account over to Mathstodon, as I didn't want to manage another Fediverse account (I have a [Hometown](https://smallcamp.art) and a currently disabled [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social) account as well). I thought that I was following a good amount of Fosstodon users to keep me engaged in that instance. However, after a few short days, I noticed that local timeline was *very* quiet and the benefits I thought I found with the federated timeline initially disappeared quickly. I know the Fediverse theoretically allows you to follow anyone on any instance, but the practical matter of curating that list is someting I didn't want to deal with. I ended up moving back to Fosstodon and deleting my Mathstodon account. I'm hoping I don't consider this again and rather try to better evaluate how I view the local timeline. I am also going to keep my eye on folks on both Mathstodon and [scholar.social](https://scholar.social) in order to stay in the loop with my interests in math and scientific research.  

## Conclusions

It's late here and I'm done rambling. Thanks for reading! Hopefully I will have something more constructive written next time.
