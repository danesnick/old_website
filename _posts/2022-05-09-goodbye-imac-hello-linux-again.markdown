One of least favorite things about my personality is I'm a perfectionist when it comes to things I use on a daily basis, **especially** with technology. Another thing is I like to minimze the number of devices I need to use to get a particular set of tasks done. This came to a hault again with my relationship with my iMac recently.

Over the past 6 months, I used the [24" M1 iMac](/blog/2021/12/18/back-to-mac/) as my primary personal computer. It was a fantastic machine and as much as I love macOS and all its integrations with other Apple products, I wasn't really getting the value out of how much it costed. Today ended up being the day I sold my 24" iMac and am now using a Linux desktop as my main computer.

This all came to a head when I built a new gaming PC, which you can see the specs on my [uses](/uses) page. I installed the recently released [Pop!`_`OS 22.04](https://blog.system76.com/post/682519660741148672/popos-2204-lts-has-landed) and was amazed how much their Cosmic desktop has evolved into its own flavor of GNOME. Key features I've enjoyed include:

* Built in (optional) tiling window manager
* Universal launcher that manages both your applications and active windows, as well as some other [spotlight-like features](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/spotlight-mchlp1008/mac)
* Extremely great [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) support for Linux gaming. Almost every game I've installed with the compatiblity layer "just works."

Even with just a few days with this computer, I realized how much I missed Linux, despite itself missing a lot of features I love about macOS. 

## iMac: All fashion, little function for me

The iMac of course had its perks. It had an extremely gorgeous 4.5K resolution display with extremely sharp retina text. Features like [Handoff](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209455) and iMessage on my desktop were extremely convenient. But these perks were overshadowed by what I actually want to do with my computer.  My main uses for a comptuer includes

* General web browsing - any computer does this well, and I would the say iMac was better in this by the display alone
* Recording demos on my drums - I have other Macs n the house that can do this (see below) and technically something like [Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/) would work fine
* Playing PC games - MacOS is notoriously limited to mobile, (some) indie and even few AAA games
* CUDA programming support - My day job has gotten me interested in learning GPU programming for scientific computing, where CUDA reigns supreme. This wasn't going to happen on a Mac.
* Virtualization/Docker - Sure support has gotten better on M1, but x86 I think will stick around a bit longer and having x86 flexiblity is nice

## Two desktop computers seem silly

After using this Linux gaming PC, I really could make this work as my main computer. Sure, I am losing some iPhone integrations, but I would say they are **icing but not the cake** of my general computing needs. If macOS ever was more competitive in the gaming space again, and had better support for things like CUDA, I would consider it.

I ended up selling it to a really nice gentleman here in Denver for a fairly good price (I lost a little money, but not a lot) and knowing that the computer will have a good home for years to come. 

## My relationship with Apple continues

Despite having rid of my iMac, I am still quite involved with their hardware, including:

* A work 13" M1 Macbook Pro
* My partners' 13" M1 Macbook Pro
* iPhone 13
* AirPods Pro
* Apple Watch Series 5

I may still consider things like my own personal Macbook or an iPad in the future, but I don't think I can make a desktop Mac my "main" device until the things above change, or my needs change. 

I will hopefully be blogging some more about how I'll be adapting my use of Apple products with a Linux desktop. Until next time...
