About 10 days ago, I made the [internal decision](https://codeberg.org/ndanes/website/commit/c1af2409f0fc83d74bfa1ad00879e5094cadb6d6) to archive my blog. I found myself unmotivated by the idea, and had no inspiration to write. However, over the past few days, I've been redesigning my website again (including significant update to my [about](/about) page), which has sort of inspired me to start writing again. I've decided to unarchive my previous blog posts and start a dedicated blog page.

## Writing for Myself

I think one of the issues I was having was trying to set expectations of the handful of potential readers would want to see. As I was redesigning my website, I realized that at the end of the day, this website is a creative outlet for me, in the same way that playing in [bands](/about/#bands), but strictly on my own terms. With this new mindset, I hope this lets me out of my writing block.

## Moving Forward

I'm still not sure what I plan to write about in the future. I don't want to place any constraints on myself. That includes great ideas such as [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/); I want to just be able to write freely when I want, whether that be weeks, months or days apart. 

I have a lot of different [interests](/about/#interests) and I would like to write about those things, but also not be limited by them. Wish me luck!
