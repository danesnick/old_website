My name is Nicholas A. Danes and I'm a Computational Scientist, helping users with their High Performance Computing support needs at [Colorado School of Mines](https://ciarc.mines.edu). I was born and raised in the Central Valley, California, but now living in Denver, Colorado.

In 2013, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science at [CSU Bakersfield](https://csub.edu). In Late 2019, I completed my PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics at [Colorado School of Mines](https://ams.mines.edu). After graduating, I worked in the industry as a Computational Engineer for less than a year, realizing I enjoyed more of the research computing/software aspect of my work, rather than the research itself, which led me take my current position as a Computational Scientist.

#### About this Site

This is just my personal website where I can express myself creatively and also hold myself accountable, whether that be in my blog posts, web pages or the web design itself. Blog posts on this site will include, but are not limited to topics on:

* Personal Growth 
* Mental Health
* Minimalism 
* Privacy
* Linux
* Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
* Technology
* Applied Mathematics
* Scientific / High Performance Computing

#### How I Created this Website

This website was created using the [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/)  (SSG) called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a combination of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and the [John Doe CSS](https://john-doe.neocities.org/) stylesheet. I highly recommend it for folks who would like to run a personal blog and also know some basics about HTML/CSS. For the color palette for the website, I tried to maintain a balance between aesthetics and [accessiblity](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html).

For editing the HTML, CSS and Markdown files, I primarily use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Neovim](https://neovim.io) with no plugins.
