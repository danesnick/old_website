My name is Nicholas A. Danes and I'm a Computational Scientist, helping users with their High Performance Computing support needs at [Colorado School of Mines](https://ciarc.mines.edu). I was born and raised in the Central Valley, California, but now living in Denver, Colorado.

In 2013, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science at [CSU Bakersfield](https://csub.edu). In Late 2019, I completed my PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics at [Colorado School of Mines](https://ams.mines.edu). After graduating, I worked in the industry as a Computational Engineer for less than a year, realizing I enjoyed more of the research computing/software aspect of my work, rather than the research itself, which led me take my current position as a Computational Scientist.

* Personal Growth 
* Mental Health
* Minimalism 
* Privacy
* Linux
* Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)
* Technology
* Applied Mathematics
* Scientific / High Performance Computing

### How I Created this Website

This website was created using the [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/)  (SSG) called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a combination of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme and the [John Doe CSS](https://john-doe.neocities.org/) stylesheet. I highly recommend it for folks who would like to run a personal blog and also know some basics about HTML/CSS. 

For editing the HTML, CSS and Markdown files, I primarily use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Neovim](https://neovim.io) with no plugins.
