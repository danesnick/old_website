# Now
I started noticing these pages on many personal websites, with a commonly linked explanation [here](https://nownownow.com/about). In short, it is another means of getting to know someone on their personal site by what currently they're working on and spending their free time. My format for my page was inspired by [Chris Beckstrom's](https://chrisbeckstrom.com/me/now/) now page.

## What I'm doing now 

*Last Updated: 2021-08-04*

### Personal Development
*  Using [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com)-style budgeting for my financial planning via spreadsheet

### Hobbies
* Learning HTML/CSS via this website
* Blogging ~~regularly~~ sporadically on random topics
* Playing drums for the second full length with my band [Broken Record](https://brokenrecordisaband.com)
	+ We are all fully COVID vaccinated now!
* Playing drums and writing an EP with my band [Faim](https://faim.bandcamp.com)
	+ We are all fully COVID vaccinated now!
* Loosely getting into [custom mechanical keyboard hobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzWm40Tq4F4) without destroying my wallet

## What I plan to do

* Building [dolfinx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx) from source and porting my graduate research code to the new platform (using C++ instead of Python), and hopefully filing issues along the way
* Learn [Julia](https://julialang.org/) by writing some basic scientific computing codes from scratch, including but not limited to:
	+ Runge-Kutta ODE Solver Example
	+ Various Linear Algebra Solvers
	+ 1D Boundary Value Problem with Dirichlet Conditions
* Learn Python web app development through [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## What I've recently done
* Tried [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com) for my financial planning, but thought it was too expensive
* ~~Sold my gaming desktop for a Thinkpad X390 ([blog post here](/blog/2021/02/06/desktop-to-laptop))~~ Also sold this thinkpad (blog post on computer setup eventually)
* Used and Learned [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) on my desktop PC as my daily driver, but I borked my system and didn't feel like fixing it.
* Shopped for a Wifi-6 Router and decided on just getting a Linksys Velop Mesh Wifi-5 Router due to a good used deal I found online!
* Cleaned up my [home desk setup](/blog/2021/01/03/mydesksetup-jan2021/)
