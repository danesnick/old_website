# Now
Although ["about"](/) pages can give you a general sense of who I am, a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page will give you a sense what I'm currently interested in and how I spent my free time. I plan to try to keep this update on a monthly basis (starting September 2021), with archived entries below.

## September 2021
