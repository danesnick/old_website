# Now
Although ["about"](/) pages can give you a general sense of who I am, a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page will give you a sense what I'm currently interested in and how I spend my free time. I plan to try to keep this update on a monthly basis (starting September 2021), with archived entries below.


## November 2021

### Hobbies
* Stepping away from the custom mechanical keyboard hobby
	- The hobby is very expensive and I want to allocate that money for other financial goals/hobbies
	- Selling other keyboards I don't use or want to keep
	- Last build is modding a Keychron C1 mechanical keyboard with Gateron Pro Yellow switches
* Finished recording another LP with [Faim](https://faim.bandcamp.com)
* Continuing to practice with [Broken Record](https://brokenrecordisaband)
* Sold my last PC (Thinkcentre M75q) and trying to use Apple Ecosystem daily by using my partner's 13" M1 Macbook Pro
